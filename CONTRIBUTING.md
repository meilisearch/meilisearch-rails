## Hacktoberfest

It's [Hacktoberfest month](https://blog.meilisearch.com/contribute-hacktoberfest-2021/)! ü•≥

üöÄ If your PR gets accepted it will count into your participation to Hacktoberfest!

‚úÖ To be accepted it has either to have been merged, approved or tagged with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.

üßê Don't forget to check the [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards)! Low-quality PRs might get marked as `spam` or `invalid`, and will not count toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the MeiliSearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [MeiliSearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rails/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rails/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-rails repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
6. Make the changes on your branch.
7. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-rails repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rails/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

```bash
bundle install
```

### Tests <!-- omit in toc -->

Set the credentials of the MeiliSearch instance as environment variables.

```
MEILISEARCH_HOST="http://127.0.0.1:7700"
MEILISEARCH_API_KEY="masterKey"
```

Each PR should pass the tests to be accepted.

```bash
# Tests
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest # Fetch the latest version of MeiliSearch image from Docker Hub
docker run -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest ./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics=true
bundle exec rspec
# Launch a single test in a specific file
bundle exec rspec spec/integration_spec.rb -e 'should include _formatted object'
# Launch tests in a specific folder or file 
bundle exec rspec spec/integration_spec.rb
```

### Linter <!-- omit in toc -->

Each PR should pass the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Check the linter errors
bundle exec rubocop lib/ spec/
# Auto-correct the linter errors
bundle exec rubocop -a lib/ spec/
```

If you think the remaining linter errors are acceptable, do not add any `rubocop` in-line comments in the code.<br>
This project uses a `rubocop_todo.yml` file that is generated. Do not modify this file manually.<br>
To update it, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config
```

### Playground <!-- omit in toc -->

First, you need to run a MeiliSearch instance:

```bash
docker run -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest ./meilisearch --no-analytics=true
```

To test directly your changes in `meilisearch-rails`, you can run the Rails playground:

```bash
cd playground
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rails webpacker:install
bundle exec rails server
```
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Set your MeiliSearch credentials by modifying the file [`playground/config/initializers/meilisearch.rb`](/playground/config/initializers/meilisearch.rb)

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in toc -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in toc -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in toc -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rails/releases/).

## Release Process (for internal team only)

MeiliSearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automation to Rebase and Merge the PRs <!-- omit in toc -->

This project integrates a bot that helps us manage pull requests merging.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/bors.md)._

### Automated Changelogs <!-- omit in toc -->

This project integrates a tool to create automated changelogs.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in toc -->

‚ö†Ô∏è Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/integration-release.md).

Make a PR modifying the file [`lib/meilisearch/version.rb`](/lib/meilisearch/version.rb) with the right version.

```ruby
VERSION = 'X.X.X' 
```

Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-rails/releases).

A GitHub Action will be triggered and push the package to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/meilisearch-rails).
